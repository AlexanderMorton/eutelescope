#This is the example for the Quad module. 
#The gear to start with is gear-beforeAlign-quad-corr-correct.xml. This is badly shifted but has the correlations in the positive direction. Must make sure that we are positively correlated for future examples. This should be done before any prealignment since the transformation from local to global is G=RL+O  R=> Rotations O => offsets G/L => Global/local coordinate system. So if you rotate then the offsets must change!  
#This gear has + correlation rotation placed in the initial matrix and z rotation. DO NOT FILL XY ROTATIONS, MILLEPEDE WILL FILL THIS WITH CORRECTIONS
#10k events used for alignment here.
#Mediums is not included. Will not make much of a difference for this setup. Can easily add this by adding a single line in config and steering file if needed. Look for IncMed in other examples. This will turn on the medium estimation in GBL fitter.
#All my gears produced are in the geometry directory 
js => -c config/config.cfg -csv runlist/runlist.csv 

#js clustering 105 <<< I start with this since I do not convert but use   js converter 105 

#js hitlocal 105
Output gear from prealignment: gear-beforeAlign-quad-corr-correct_pre.xml

#js patternRecognition  105

#TripletConnectDistCut =  1 1
#TripletSlopeCuts = 0.01 0.01
#DoubletCenDistCut = 0.5 0.5
#DoubletDistCut =   0.5 0.5
#excludeplanes=     
#DUTWindow= 0.5

#js GBLAlign  105

Resolutions are input in z order. This is different between SLAC and DESY runs. Must change.

Initial alignent with settings:

#FixXshifts=0  5  
#FixYshifts=0  5     
#FixZshifts=0  5     
#FixXrot=   0  5  
#FixYrot=   0  5 
#FixZrot=   0 5 
#r = 0.05
#dutX= 0.1 0.1
#dutY=0.1 0.1

Resolution set to 50 microns due to initial misalignment.
Output gear:alignedGear-iter1-run000105.xml (Use your own name or you will overwrite example gears which you can use as reference)

Change parameters:
#r = 0.005
#dutX= 0.1 0.1
#dutY=0.1 0.1
and then run again. Output gear:alignedGear-iter2-run000105.xml

Final alignment good but error on weak mode alignment large. Increase stats will fix this. 
For final analysis tracks run:
#js GBLTrackFit 105

#########################################################SLAC 361 (MUST CHANGE RESOLUTION ORDER IN CONFIG. Note finished. 
#Possible problem: Z position not precise. Would not expect this to be an issue however.
Using 1k events which should be plenty for SLAC.
Using gear:gear-beforeAlign-quad-361SLAC.xml  First and last z postion correct all others off. This is not a big deal since a very weak mode for SLAC due to tiny beam divergence. Furthermore if it became a factor then millepede would correct for it. 

#js converter 361
#js clustering 361
#js hitlocal 361

Note prealignment does not behave itself with DUTs after the last mimosa so do not use prealigned gear. Go straight to pattern recognition and apply the correct cuts.


#js patternRecognition 361

After looking a histograms I ran with these cuts:
#TripletConnectDistCut =  1 1
#TripletSlopeCuts = 0.01 0.01
#DoubletCenDistCut = 0.5 0.5
#DoubletDistCut =   0.5 0.5
#excludeplanes=     
#DUTWindow= 0.5

Small number of track due to misalignment. Will have to run a pattern recognition again but first we should align.

#js GBLAlign  361

Rotations and z shifts must be fixed! Very small beam divergence.


#FixXshifts=0  5  
#FixYshifts=0  5     
#FixZshifts=0 1 2 3 4 5 20 21
